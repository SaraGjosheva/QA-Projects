# Coin Tracker - Manual Testing

Active engagement in the project Coin Tracker (mobile application) was demonstrated through collaborative teamwork and initiative in developing manual test cases. This included the design, execution, and reporting of tests, employing suitable methods like decision tables, boundary value analysis (BVA), and state transition diagrams.
